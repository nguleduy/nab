# Assignment
A small start-up named "iCommerce" wants to build a very simple online shopping application to sell their products. In order to get to the market quickly, they just want to build an MVP version with a very limited set of functionalities:

a. The application is simply a simple web page that shows all products on which customers can filter, short and search for products based on different criteria such as name, price, brand, colour etc.

b. All product prices are subject to change at any time and the company wants to keep track of it.

c. If a customer finds a product that they like, they can add it to their shopping cart and proceed to place an order.

d. For audit support, all customers' activities such as searching, filtering and viewing product's details need to be stored in the database. However, failure to store customer activity is completely transparent to customer and should have no impact to the activity itself.

e. Customer can login simply by clicking the button “Login with Facebook”. No further account registration is required.

f. No online payment is supported yet. Customer is required to pay by cash when the product got delivered.
